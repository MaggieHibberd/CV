##  Interests
Co-Founder Welcome Presents
Sep 2016 – Present
London, United Kingdom
Established in 2016, Welcome Presents aims to bridge the divide between refugees, asylum seekers and the wider UK public, and seeks to have a positive impact on the lives of those displaced and struggling in London. Newcomers to this city are often marginalised socially.

Integration is a multi-dimensional process that takes time, especially in London, where locals are more likely to read about refugees than engage with the people behind the stories.

Welcome Presents is a move to address this uncertainty, lending a hand to step over the divide. https://www.welcomepresents.com/
